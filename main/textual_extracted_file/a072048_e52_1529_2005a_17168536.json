The quartzite unit forms part of a package \n of  meta-sediments  that  includes  talc-chlorite  schist,  shale  and  inter-bedded  BIF \n horizons. To the west of this low ridge, a dolerite dyke crops out. \n The  talc-chlorite  schist  crops  out  sporadically  over  approximately  500m  and  has  a \n very strong foliation that dips steeply to the east. The southern most line of historical \n drilling almost exclusively intersects this unit.  \n To the east of the schist is a fine grained massive quartzite unit. The unit forms a low \n ridge trending 340\u00b0-350\u00b0 and is ~20 \u2013 30m thick and 250m long. The rock has a fine \n sugary  texture  and  breaks  down  to  a  fine  siliceous  powder  when  hammered. \n Sporadic milky quartz veins to 100mm occur, normal to the dominant ~ N-S foliation \n in the area, along the length of the quartzite. Further to the north (~ 500m) the unit \n East of the quartzite is a large package of sub-cropping shales sparsely inter-bedded \n with thin bands of BIF. The shale is finely laminated (5 \u2013 10mm) and strongly foliated \n parallel to bedding (sub-vertical trending ~340\u00b0-350\u00b0). The BIF bands tend to be less \n than 200mm thick with alternating chert bands to 20mm. Little veining or alteration is \n noted in this unit and Au anomalism abruptly ends within it.  \n Approximately 200m to the west of the low lying ridge of quartzite is a ?dolerite dyke \n that  sub-crops  through  the  alluvial  cover.  The  dyke  is  approximately  30m  wide \n (perhaps thinner) and appears to be co-incident with an interpreted 110\u00b0 structure.  \n A series of ~110\u00b0 structures are interpreted to have been dextrally displaced by the \n quartzite by approximately 10 \u2013 15m.
