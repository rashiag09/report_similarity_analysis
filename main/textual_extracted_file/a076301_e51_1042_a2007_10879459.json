Reconnaissance  drilling \n should target, at a minimum, the regional redox front, especially where it is believed \n to be preserved.  \n"}, {"bbox": [224.372748725419, 643.094251092498, 574.034552075747, 41.2127370721049], "segmentation": [[224.372748725419, 643.094251092498, 798.407300801166, 643.094251092498, 798.407300801166, 684.3069881646029, 224.372748725419, 684.3069881646029]], "category_id": 9, "category": "subsection", "page": 10, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [141.947274581209, 696.08205589949, 1324.6951201748, 1006.76829133285], "segmentation": [[141.947274581209, 696.08205589949, 1466.642394756009, 696.08205589949, 1466.642394756009, 1702.85034723234, 141.947274581209, 1702.85034723234]], "category_id": 7, "category": "paragraph", "page": 10, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"47": {"bbox": [292, 790, 304, 806], "text": "10\n"}}, "bbox": [[292, 790, 304, 806]], "ordered_list": ["47"]}, "text": "10\n"}, {"bbox": [225.351278659869, 1802.08527571012, 491.020324544792, 45.9227641660596], "segmentation": [[225.351278659869, 1802.08527571012, 716.371603204661, 1802.08527571012, 716.371603204661, 1848.0080398761795, 225.351278659869, 1848.0080398761795]], "category_id": 16, "category": "figure_caption", "page": 11, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [162.436437581938, 1724.51701700655, 423.902438455936, 56.5203251274579], "segmentation": [[162.436437581938, 1724.51701700655, 586.338876037874, 1724.51701700655, 586.338876037874, 1781.037342134008, 162.436437581938, 1781.037342134008]], "category_id": 16, "category": "figure_caption", "page": 12, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [195.264890313183, 997.976257793154, 455.695121340131, 60.0528454479245], "segmentation": [[195.264890313183, 997.976257793154, 650.960011653314, 997.976257793154, 650.960011653314, 1058.0291032410785, 195.264890313183, 1058.0291032410785]], "category_id": 16, "category": "figure_caption", "page": 13, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [177.599563000728, 185.319412927895, 1264.64227472688, 522.813007428988], "segmentation": [[177.599563000728, 185.319412927895, 1442.241837727608, 185.319412927895, 1442.241837727608, 708.132420356883, 177.599563000728, 708.132420356883]], "category_id": 24, "category": "references", "page": 14, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"12": {"bbox": [89, 177, 442, 193], "text": "St Barbara Mines, 1999.
