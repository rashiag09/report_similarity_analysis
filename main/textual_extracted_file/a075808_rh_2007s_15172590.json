The Eastern Ultramafic Unit occurs as a discontinuous series of thin lenses (<80m thick) \n of thin differentiated Komatiite flows located towards the top of the Maggie Hays Formation. \n The overlying Honman Formation comprises a lower sequence of minor banded iron formation, \n clastic  sediments,  felsic  volcanics  and  volcaniclastics,  overlain  by  the  Central  Ultramafic  Unit \n which hosts the Maggie Hays and Emily Ann Deposits.  The Central Ultramafic Unit extends up \n to  600m  in  thickness  and  consists  of  highly  magnesian  olivine  cumulates  indicative  of \n continuous, voluminous eruption of lava.  In the vicinity of Maggie Hays the Komatiite sequence \n from east to west consists of 50-60m of basal olivine orthocumulate intercalated with pyroxene \n orthocumulate; passing up to a thick olivine meso-adcumulate which fractionates upwards into \n pyroxene-olivine cumulate and pyroxene-plagioclase cumulate.  A thin flow top is developed in \n places.  This  fractionation  sequence  is  indicative  of  ponding  of  lava  in  a  stagnant  lava  lake \n analogous  to  Kurrajong  (Walter  Williams  Formation),  and  also  analogous  to  the  upper \n fractionated ponded flows of the Eastern Ultramafic Unit at Mt Keith. \n The Central Ultramafic Unit is overlain by the Glasse Formation which is characterised by the \n first appearance of a regionally persistent banded iron formation 150m thick (quartz-magnetite-\n actinolite;  quartz-pyrrhotite-pyrite;  quartz-garnet-diopside-actinolite-magnetite)  and  felsic  tuffs \n intercalated with the lowermost flows of the Western Ultramafic Unit.  The Western Ultramafic \n Unit  is  up  to  400m  thick  and  consists  of  a  fractionated  series  of  thin  differentiated  komatiitic \n flows  with  variable  MgO  contents,  well-preserved  spinifex-textures  and  olivine  cumulate  B \n Zones. High-Mg basalts and amphibolites cap the Western Ultramafic Unit.  This ultramafic unit \n has been interpreted by Perring et al ibid to result from alternating periods of quiescence and \n episodic  sheet  flow  volcanism  with  development  of  inflated  lava  tubes  in  zones  of  focussed \n sustained lava flow. \n The  entirety  of  the  belt's  nickel  endowment  is  hosted  within  the  Central  Ultramafic  Unit, \n however,  disseminated  and  low  tenor  nickel  mineralisation  is  known  from  the  the  Western \n Ultramafic Unit.  Disseminated Ni-Cu sulphide has been drilled by LionOre Australia (Nickel) Ltd \n at Emily Ann North (2m @ 0.75% Ni, 433ppm Cu) and  Central Pacific Minerals NL drilled 1% \n Ni, Cu<200ppm in olivine cumulates in the Western Ultramafic Unit west of Roundtop Hill in the \n Jimberlana  Prospect.    The  association  of  amphibolite,  banded-iron  formation,  and  olivine \n cumulate with fractionated komatiites in E63/987 suggests that the the stratigraphy may be the \n dismembered, folded Western Ultramafic Unit, rather than the Eastern Ultramafic Unit as has \n 5 \n"}, {"bbox": [176.656814371258, 214.055790943115, 484.046946107784, 51.631674251497], "segmentation": [[176.656814371258, 214.055790943115, 660.703760479042, 214.055790943115, 660.703760479042, 265.687465194612, 176.656814371258, 265.687465194612]], "category_id": 9, "category": "subsection", "page": 8, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"12": {"bbox": [70, 206, 541, 221], "text": "sequence has been folded into a series of antiforms and synforms with variable plunges to the \n"}, "13": {"bbox": [70, 219, 541, 233], "text": "northwest  and  southeast.
