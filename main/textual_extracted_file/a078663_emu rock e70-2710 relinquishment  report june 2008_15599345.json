A joint venture with Magnetic Resources NL was entered \n into  in  October  2006  and  Magnetic  is  currently  the  operator  of  the  project.    The \n tenement  is  located  approximately  70km  east  of  the  town  of  Hyden  and  south  of \n Hyden-Norseman  Road.    Access  is  via  gravel  roads  and  farm  tracks.    Most  of  the \n tenement is covered by freehold farm land (sheep, cereal crops). \n WORK CARRIED OUT FEBRUARY 2006 TO 2007 \n Persistent waves of wet weather forced several field programs to be cancelled. \n Eventually  some  road  side  sampling  was  achieved  but  results  suggest  that  soil \n sampling  does  not  work  in  this  area  and  a  program  of  roadside  RAB  drilling  was \n planned during the following field season. \n A  review  of  the  project  failed  to  identify  targets  of  sufficient  merit  to  justify  the \n expense  of  obtaining  land  holder  access  and  subsequent  drilling  therefore  the \n tenement was relinquished on 1 February 2008.   \n Sample locations and results are included in an appendix along with aeromagnetic and \n 1 \n"}, {"bbox": [233.93020811497, 1315.15438992222, 1190.75548742515, 274.293269461078], "segmentation": [[233.93020811497, 1315.15438992222, 1424.68569554012, 1315.15438992222, 1424.68569554012, 1589.4476593832978, 233.93020811497, 1589.4476593832978]], "category_id": 5, "category": "paragraph", "page": 2, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [240.384167396407, 1595.90161866474, 919.68919760479, 77.4475113772455], "segmentation": [[240.384167396407, 1595.90161866474, 1160.073365001197, 1595.90161866474, 1160.073365001197, 1673.3491300419855, 240.384167396407, 1673.3491300419855]], "category_id": 9, "category": "subsection", "page": 2, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [233.93020811497, 1240.9338581857, 700.254582035928, 74.2205317365269], "segmentation": [[233.93020811497, 1240.9338581857, 934.184790150898, 1240.9338581857, 934.184790150898, 1315.154389922227, 233.93020811497, 1315.154389922227]], "category_id": 9, "category": "subsection", "page": 2, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [240.384167396407, 1673.34913004198, 1190.75548742515, 506.635803592814], "segmentation": [[240.384167396407, 1673.34913004198, 1431.139654821557, 1673.34913004198, 1431.139654821557, 2179.9849336347943, 240.384167396407, 2179.9849336347943]], "category_id": 5, "category": "paragraph", "page": 2, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [235.2588332668, 146.368399006987, 1219.79830419162, 491.791697245509], "segmentation": [[235.2588332668, 146.368399006987, 1455.05713745842, 146.368399006987, 1455.05713745842, 638.160096252496, 235.2588332668, 638.160096252496]], "category_id": 24, "category": "appendix_list", "page": 3, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"5": {"bbox": [126, 133, 491, 152], "text": "ASSAY RESULTS (5 PLANS) Zn, Au, Cu, As, Pb - 1:10,000 \n"}, "6": {"bbox": [239, 149, 377, 168], "text": "GEOLOGY - 1:50,000 \n"}, "7": {"bbox": [212, 166, 405, 184], "text": "AEROMAGNETICS - 1:50,000 \n"}, "8": {"bbox": [215, 182, 402, 200], "text": "LANDSAT IMAGE \u2013 1:50,000 \n"}, "9": {"bbox": [229, 198, 363, 218], "text": "     ASSAY RESULTS \n"}}, "bbox": [[126, 133, 491, 152], [239, 149, 377, 168], [212, 166, 405, 184], [215, 182, 402, 200], [229, 198, 363, 218]], "ordered_list": ["5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]}, "text": "ASSAY RESULTS (5 PLANS) Zn, Au, Cu, As, Pb - 1:10,000 \n GEOLOGY - 1:50,000 \n AEROMAGNETICS - 1:50,000 \n LANDSAT IMAGE \u2013 1:50,000 \n      ASSAY RESULTS \n"}, {"bbox": [23.7911342265532, 15.8974434595858, 2203.53970669915, 1568.47129257004], "segmentation": [[23.7911342265532, 15.8974434595858, 2227.3308409257033, 15.8974434595858, 2227.3308409257033, 1584.3687360296258, 23.7911342265532, 1584.3687360296258]], "category_id": 3, "category": "other", "page": 14, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}]
