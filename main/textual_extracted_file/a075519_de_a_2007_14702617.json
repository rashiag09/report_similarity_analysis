Following completion of this \n work by Saracen, Yilgarn is now holding discussions with Saracen regarding a possible \n CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n Exploration  drilling  to  date  has  indicated  that  there  is  limited  potential  for  significant \n oxide resources at shallow depth outside the known mineralised zone associated with the \n Central  BIF  horizon.    Given  the  relatively  shallow  depth  of  the  existing  drilling,  the \n exploration potential at depth greater than 100m is still largely unknown at the Central \n BIF unit (only 7 holes have intersected the BIF between 50m and 150m below surface).  \n Detailed  study  of  the  drilling  to  date  has  also  indicated  the  possibility  for  multiple \n stacked, shallow to moderately southerly plunging ore-shoots, at moderate depth along \n the  Central  BIF.    Further  drilling  is  warranted  to  test  the  down-plunge  extensions  of \n intersections in holes DWP051 (5m @ 3.1 g/t Au, DWRC02 (5m @ 2 g/t Au),.DWRC06 \n (2m @ 6.6 g/t Au), DWP037 (3m @ 4 g/t Au), and DWP063 (3m @ 4.5 g/t Au). \n"}, {"bbox": [132.849839708667, 565.675361303714, 1398.87804690459, 508.682926147123], "segmentation": [[132.849839708667, 565.675361303714, 1531.727886613257, 565.675361303714, 1531.727886613257, 1074.358287450837, 132.849839708667, 1074.358287450837]], "category_id": 2, "category": "references", "page": 11, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [243.06447370721, 150.250971616897, 1271.70731536781, 360.317072687546], "segmentation": [[243.06447370721, 150.250971616897, 1514.77178907502, 150.250971616897, 1514.77178907502, 510.568044304443, 243.06447370721, 510.568044304443]], "category_id": 19, "category": "paragraph", "page": 11, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"7": {"bbox": [107, 140, 540, 154], "text": "Yilgarn is currently holding discussions with Saracen Gold  (the holder of the adjacent \n"}, "8": {"bbox": [107, 153, 540, 168], "text": "Deep  South  deposit  and  the  proximal  Carosue  treatment  plant)  regarding  possible \n"}, "9": {"bbox": [107, 167, 451, 182], "text": "collaborative development of the established Deep Well gold resource. \n"}, "14": {"bbox": [107, 238, 540, 253], "text": "Burrows,  G.F.,  1988.    1987  Annual/Surrender  Report  Mining  Lease  M39/17  \u201cDeep \n"}, "15": {"bbox": [107, 252, 540, 267], "text": "Well\u201d Project.
