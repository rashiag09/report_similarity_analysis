Small pockets of greenstones reached amphibolite facies. \n The largest and most complex of the greenstone belts is the Jimblebar greenstone belt, which is \n located  in  the  northeastern  sector  of  the  Sylvania  Inlier,  and  overlain  in  the  north  by  Late \n Archaean  felsic  volcanic  rocks  belonging  to  the  Fortescue  Group  and  the  Early  Proterozoic \n Marra  Mamba  Iron  Formation  of  the  Hammersley  Group.  The  magnetic  signature  of  the \n greenstones  indicates  that  they  continue  north  for  two  kilometres  beneath  Fortescue  and \n Hammersley  Group  rocks.    The  greenstones  form  a  strongly  arcuate  northerly  to  westerly \n trending belt with a total length of approximately 25 kilometres, varying from 0.5 kilometres to \n 12.5 kilometres wide. It is comprised of intercalated fine to very coarse grained clastic rocks, \n cherts,  banded  iron  formation,  ultramafic  to  felsic  volcanic  rocks,  a  significant  ultramafic  to \n mafic layered intrusion, and the Coobina ultramafic intrusion.   \n Several generations of faults have affected the belt. They include early north trending strike slip \n faults,  with  associated  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Shearers  and  Sunny  South  areas,  easterly \n striking southerly dipping reverse and thrust faults, plus a significant easterly striking southerly \n dipping fault zone, The Cubana fault, with minor associated Pb Ba mineralisation, probably of \n Proterozoic  age.  Late  stage  northeast  striking  sinistral  faults  are  common,  and  occasional \n northwest striking sinistral and dextral faults occur.  \n Thrust  faulting  clearly  affects  the  granites  in  places.  A  thick  low  angle  south  to  southwest \n dipping mylonite within a broad zone of sheared granite has been observed near the Sylvania \n homestead turn - off from the Great Northern Highway. Its age is not known. \n The second period of tectonism was related to the early Proterozoic Capricorn Orogeny, and led \n to  the  formation  of  major  easterly  trending  shear  zones  and  thrust  faults.  Reactivation  of \n Archaean structures was common. \n HISTORICAL EXPLORATION \n Alluvial gold was first discovered in the Jimblebar greenstone belt in 1887. Several hard rock \n gold  discoveries  associated  with  shear  zones  and  altered  mafic  rocks  related  to  banded  iron \n formation,  followed.  Scattered  small  gold  workings,  generally  in  shear  zones  in  altered  mafic \n and  ultramafic  rocks,  occur  elsewhere  in  the  belt.  A  state  battery  was  established  during  the \n 1930s to treat ore from the area. Total recorded production was 107 kilograms of gold. Western \n Mining Company drilled several diamond drill holes in the Sunny South area in the 1960s, and \n Pancontinental Mining conducted extensive gold exploration in the area from 1980 to 1985. \n BHP  Pty  Co  Ltd  and  L  Ives  [1952  and  1957]  produced  14,650  tonnes  of  chromite  from  the \n Coobina Chromite Deposit.
