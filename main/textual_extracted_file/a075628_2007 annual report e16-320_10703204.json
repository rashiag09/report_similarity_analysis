It  is  located  in  the  north  western  part  of  the \n Kalgoorlie 1:250,000 map sheet.  Access is west, along poor tracks off the Menzies-\n Evanston Road from Davy Hurst. \n A  single  old  exploration  rack  passes  northwards  directly  east  of    the  tenement \n although  this  is  in  very  poor  condition  and  difficulty  may  be  experienced  crossing \n 3.0  TOPOGRAPHY AND VEGETATION \n The area is generally flat to gently rolling, with occasional low ridges of outcrop in \n the north east.  Drainage courses are essentially absent, while small, shallow claypans \n occur in the south and east. \n Much of the area is covered by dense low scrub \u2013 dominantly Grevillia and Ti-tree \u2013 \n although stands of Eucalyptus are present and increase to the north. \n"}, {"bbox": [230.539156278525, 1827.55130768878, 617.300953648259, 45.3897760035486], "segmentation": [[230.539156278525, 1827.55130768878, 847.840109926784, 1827.55130768878, 847.840109926784, 1872.9410836923287, 230.539156278525, 1872.9410836923287]], "category_id": 9, "category": "subsection", "page": 2, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [220.521902386248, 1255.18430864188, 658.281437125748, 43.5741849634064], "segmentation": [[220.521902386248, 1255.18430864188, 878.803339511996, 1255.18430864188, 878.803339511996, 1298.7584936052865, 220.521902386248, 1298.7584936052865]], "category_id": 9, "category": "subsection", "page": 3, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [225.440083891355, 291.138332659737, 1221.32215568862, 934.479520958084], "segmentation": [[225.440083891355, 291.138332659737, 1446.762239579975, 291.138332659737, 1446.762239579975, 1225.6178536178209, 225.440083891355, 1225.6178536178209]], "category_id": 5, "category": "paragraph", "page": 3, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"16": {"bbox": [90, 281, 508, 297], "text": "Bedrock  is  covered  by  a  variety  of  Pleistocene  to  Recent  sediments  consisting  of \n"}, "17": {"bbox": [90, 295, 508, 310], "text": "yellow Aeolian sands and paler alluvial to lacustrine sands, silts and clays.

Such lags are entirely absent in areas of thickly \n vegetated yellow dune sands, but are developed to some extent along the margins of \n the ridge which defines the greenstone belt where sand cover is thin or absent. \n Some overgrown east-west grid lines were noted probably to undertake soil sampling \n but no results have been discovered on open file. Field inspection would suggest that \n this  sort  of  work  would  be  ineffective  given  the  nature  of  the  surface  cover. \n Exploration next field season would include ground magnetics, auger sampling and \n geochemical  bed  rock  drilling.  A  considerable  amount  of  track  clearing  in  this \n extremely  difficult  and  isolated  terrain  will  be  required  to  accomplish  any  of  these \n 5 \n"}, {"bbox": [630.578861221557, 398.058269655023, 390.611443779108, 432.629407850965], "segmentation": [[630.578861221557, 398.058269655023, 1021.1903050006649, 398.058269655023, 1021.1903050006649, 830.687677505988, 630.578861221557, 830.687677505988]], "category_id": 5, "category": "paragraph", "page": 7, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [678.821708859614, 289.122807246507, 287.900864936793, 84.0359281437126], "segmentation": [[678.821708859614, 289.122807246507, 966.722573796407, 289.122807246507, 966.722573796407, 373.1587353902196, 678.821708859614, 373.1587353902196]], "category_id": 9, "category": "subsection", "page": 7, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}]
