This  survey \n remains to be processed and analysed before target interpretation can begin. Results will \n be reported in the next reporting period. \n Interpretation of Geophysics \n Using a combination of uranium, potassium, thorium and total counts with magnetics or \n elevation models the tenement was subjected to analysis for: \n \u0004 Surface drainage features \n \u0004 Sub-surface structures \n \u0004 Target areas where combined effects were of interest \n The map of uranium count contours shows a large E-W alluvial drainage anomaly that is \n approximately 6.5 kilometres across and extends for about 28 kilometres along the length \n of the lease within the alluvial plain of the Gascoyne River. There are also several smaller \n anomalies. All the anomalous areas have a radiometric reading in the order of 5.2 to 6.9 \n ppm (orange/red colour in the map below) against the aircraft background of 0.37 ppm U \n count in the area. Therefore the anomalies are considered real and indicate that uranium \n is present at about 16 times background. \n The magnetic patterns also show a strongly defined E-W alluvial channel zone, probably \n from  the  magnetic  minerals  in  the  calcretes,  alluvial  laterites  and  detrital  channel  fill \n deposits  within  the  Gascoyne  River  Tertiary  and  Recent  deposition  sequence.  Some \n magnetic linear features of west-northwest or east-northeast orientation are also present. \n These  could  be  basement  faults  or  fractures.  The  strong  magnetic  signatures  within  an \n west-trending  drainage  across  the  tenement  may  be  buried  channels  since  they  are  not \n identical to the current river channels and lie oblique to them. Where these are coincident \n with high uranium response radiation counts they are significant targets. \n If  the  uranium  count  and  1st  Vertical  Derivative  Magnetics  are  superimposed  it  can  be \n seen  that  the  anomalous  uranium  areas  are  related  to  surface  as  well  as  sub-surface \n drainage features in the two tenements. There are significant parallel magnetic high and \n uranium-bearing  anomalies  that  may  reflect  older  drainages,  perhaps  palaeo-channels. \n The  current  Gascoyne  River  has  a  strong  influence  and  overprint  on  the  drainage  and \n tends to mask or cover some of its older channels. \n Target generation from the various geophysical results is currently being undertaken and \n will form the basis of the next year\u2019s exploration program. \n   7\n"}, {"bbox": [227.724768075441, 189.197170603444, 1090.22021052632, 68.3761804511279], "segmentation": [[227.724768075441, 189.197170603444, 1317.944978601761, 189.197170603444, 1317.944978601761, 257.5733510545719, 227.724768075441, 257.5733510545719]], "category_id": 5, "category": "paragraph", "page": 8, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"19": {"bbox": [200, 191, 445, 204], "text": "Mineral Agencies Australia Pty Ltd \u2013 Consultancy \n"}, "21": {"bbox": [200, 223, 454, 236], "text": "Schwann Consulting Pty Ltd \u2013 Geologist Field Visit \n"}}, "bbox": [[200, 191, 445, 204], [200, 223, 454, 236]], "ordered_list": ["19", "21"]}, "text": "Mineral Agencies Australia Pty Ltd \u2013 Consultancy \n Schwann Consulting Pty Ltd \u2013 Geologist Field Visit \n"}, {"bbox": [239.120798150629, 1173.05443376134, 376.068992481203, 56.9801503759397], "segmentation": [[239.120798150629, 1173.05443376134, 615.189790631832, 1173.05443376134, 615.189790631832, 1230.0345841372798, 239.120798150629, 1230.0345841372798]], "category_id": 6, "category": "section", "page": 8, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {}, "bbox": [], "ordered_list": []}, "text": ""}, {"bbox": [227.724768075441, 117.022313460587, 486.230616541353, 72.1748571428571], "segmentation": [[227.724768075441, 117.022313460587, 713.955384616794, 117.022313460587, 713.955384616794, 189.1971706034441, 227.724768075441, 189.1971706034441]], "category_id": 6, "category": "section", "page": 8, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"14": {"bbox": [200, 105, 234, 119], "text": "Detail \n"}, "15": {"bbox": [200, 124, 423, 137], "text": "GPX Airborne Services Pty Ltd \u2013 Geophysics \n"}, "16": {"bbox": [200, 138, 283, 151], "text": "Airborne Survey \n"}, "17": {"bbox": [200, 156, 428, 169], "text": "Geologica Pty Ltd - Geophysical Interpretation \n"}, "18": {"bbox": [200, 173, 434, 187], "text": "HyVista Corporation Pty Ltd \u2013 Airborne Survey \n"}, "32": {"bbox": [464, 105, 531, 119], "text": "Expenditure \n"}, "33": {"bbox": [464, 120, 521, 133], "text": "$55,311.15 \n"}}, "bbox": [[200, 105, 234, 119], [200, 124, 423, 137], [200, 138, 283, 151], [200, 156, 428, 169], [200, 173, 434, 187], [464, 105, 531, 119], [464, 120, 521, 133]], "ordered_list": ["16", "32", "33", "14", "15", "17", "18"]}, "text": "Airborne Survey \n Expenditure \n $55,311.15 \n Detail \n GPX Airborne Services Pty Ltd \u2013 Geophysics \n Geologica Pty Ltd - Geophysical Interpretation \n HyVista Corporation Pty Ltd \u2013 Airborne Survey \n"}, {"bbox": [227.724768075441, 257.573351054572, 1310.54345864662, 892.689022556391], "segmentation": [[227.724768075441, 257.573351054572, 1538.268226722061, 257.573351054572, 1538.268226722061, 1150.262373610963, 227.724768075441, 1150.262373610963]], "category_id": 4, "category": "title", "page": 8, "relations": {"child": [], "parent": [], "above": [], "following": [], "context": []}, "textline": {"lines": {"23": {"bbox": [200, 259, 368, 272], "text": "Meekatharra Shire Rates and Rent \n"}, "24": {"bbox": [200, 287, 425, 300], "text": "Corporate and legal transfers etc for E52/2115 \n"}, "25": {"bbox": [200, 301, 401, 314], "text": "Contract preparation for airborne surveys \n"}, "26": {"bbox": [200, 315, 404, 328], "text": "Tenement management fees and reporting \n"}, "27": {"bbox": [200, 328, 392, 342], "text": "Negotiations, meetings and discussions \n"}, "28": {"bbox": [200, 342, 293, 356], "text": "Report preparation \n"}, "34": {"bbox": [464, 259, 515, 272], "text": "$9,344.73 \n"}, "35": {"bbox": [464, 287, 515, 300], "text": "$6,465.59 \n"}, "37": {"bbox": [472, 384, 529, 398], "text": "$71,121.47 \n"}, "42": {"bbox": [90, 453, 524, 467], "text": "The data generated from the geophysical and spectral image surveys will be analysed and \n"}, "43": {"bbox": [90, 467, 401, 481], "text": "interpreted so that exploration and drill targets can be generated. \n"}, "44": {"bbox": [90, 481, 524, 494], "text": "The  next  phase  of  exploration  will  include  \u201cground-truthing\u201d  of  identified  targets  and \n"}, "45": {"bbox": [90, 495, 524, 508], "text": "anomalies.
